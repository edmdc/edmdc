### About me

I grew up splitting time between Austin, TX and Mexico; After high school, I lived
in Germany for a year as a student. My time in these places taught me to
appreciate the relationships between cultures, languages, and how these color
people's stories.

I view Software as the translation point for the stories told between machines
and humans. Like spoken languages, programming languages have unique qualities
that make them ideal for different situations. As a burgeoning developer,
I seek to understand these qualities to create performant software that's
enjoyable for the user, and easy to maintain by other developers.
