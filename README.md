### About me

I grew up splitting time between Austin, TX, and San Luis Potosi, Mexico. After high school, I spent a year living with a host family in Germany. My time in these places taught me to appreciate the relationships between the many things that color our daily lives and shape our behavior. As a developer, I use this adeptness to create equitable, enjoyable software.
 
I decided to join the tech industry because it seemed a good fit for my natural linguistic skills and analytical mind. My initial passion for software development came from problem-solving and the deep thinking required to accomplish a task. As I gained experience, this passion matured to include the potential to bring people together by applying all that I have learned through my life and travels. It's become less about problem-solving and more about learning from people to affect their lives for the better.
